// Task 1
/**
You are coding an RPG game, where each character has certain skill levels based on the value saved in their score.

Create a variable named  score and set it to  8

Use console.log() that includes the string "Mid-level skills:" and compares the score variable to above 0 and below 10 using the && operator

The expected output in the console should be: "Mid-level skills: true".
 */
let score = 8;

console.log("Mid-level skills:", score > 0 && score < 10)
// Task 2
/**
 Imagine you are coding a video game. Currently, youâ€™re about to code some snippets related to the game over condition.

You need to code a new variable named timeRemaining and set it to 0. You also need to code a new variable named energy and set it to 10.

Next, you should write a piece of code that could be used to determine if the game is over, based on whether either the value of the timeRemaining variable is 0 or the value of the energy variable is 0.

Complete the task using the following steps:

Declare the variable timeRemaining, and assign the value of 0 to it.

Declare the variable energy, and assign the value of 10 to it.

Console log the following parameters: "Game over: ", and timeRemaining == 0 || energy == 0

Note that the expected output in the console should be: "Game over: true".
 */
let timeRemaining = 0;
let energy = 0;
console.log("Game over: ", timeRemaining == 0 || energy == 0);
